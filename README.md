# Object.entries() in Next.js 15 – Real Examples

This project demonstrates how to use `Object.entries()` in modern React projects built with **Next.js 15**. You’ll explore how to loop through objects, generate dynamic form fields, group data, and even combine it with `.reduce()` to count object values — all with practical, hands-on examples.

## What This Project Covers

- Iterating through simple objects with `Object.entries()`
- Rendering grouped data dynamically by category
- Generating form fields from an object structure
- Combining `Object.entries()` with `.reduce()` to count values (e.g. "online" vs. "offline")
- Bonus tips for flat object rendering and mapping
